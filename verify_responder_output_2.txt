Testing Intent: 'question'
User Input: 'What is React?'
Tool Results: []
✅ Response: React is a popular open-source **JavaScript library** used for building user interfaces (UIs), particularly for single-page applications. Developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook), it allows developers to create reusable UI components.

Key features of React include:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** You build the UI using small, isolated pieces of code called "components." These components can be nested and reused throughout an application.
*   **Declarative UI:** You describe how the UI should look for a specific state, and React automatically updates and renders the right components when your data changes.
*   **Virtual DOM:** React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in memory. When state changes, it calculates the most efficient way to update the browser's DOM, which significantly improves performance.
*   **JSX (JavaScript XML):** A syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like structures directly within your JavaScript code.

React is widely used in modern web development and serves as the foundation for mobile development through **React Native**.
